# Gender or Sex
### By [Sasha Dorofeev](https://sashadorofeev.net/)
#### Experimental Software

This is the software that I used to run the experiment "Gender or Sex." The goal of the project is to develop an empirical concept of gender, which is independent of biological sex. In this experiment, I collect the data to develop this definition of gender. You can read more about the project on my [website](https://sashadorofeev.net/research). The working paper is also available [online](https://sashadorofeev.net/assets/drafts/gos.pdf).

You can run a demo of the experiment online using Heroku:
1. Go to https://democracy-demo.herokuapp.com/
2. Click "Democracy Baseline"
3. Open the experiment in a split screen mode or open the session-wide demo link 3 times

Note that once you complete Part I of the experiment (page 8: WaitBetweenParts), you need to manually advance all users to Part II. If you test the software in the split screen mode, press ``Advance slowest user(s)`` button. If you have each participant's screen on a separate tab, go back to the session's homepage, press ``Monitor`` and then ``Advance slowest user(s)``.

You can also run the experiment locally, but you need to install [oTree](https://www.otree.org/) to your computer first.
