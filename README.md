# Gender or Sex
### By [Sasha Dorofeev](https://sashadorofeev.net/)
#### Experimental Software

This is the software that I used to run the experiment "Gender or Sex." The goal of the project is to develop an empirical concept of gender, which is independent of biological sex. In this experiment, I collect the data to develop this definition of gender. You can read more about the project on my [website](https://sashadorofeev.net/research). The working paper is also available [online](https://sashadorofeev.net/assets/drafts/gos.pdf).

You can run a demo of the experiment online using Heroku:
1. Go to https://gender-or-sex.herokuapp.com/
2. Click "Gender or Sex: Experiment 1"
3. Open the experiment by clicking session-wide demo link

You can also run the experiment locally, but you need to install [oTree](https://www.otree.org/) to your computer first.
