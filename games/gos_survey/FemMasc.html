    <p>
    Please write down adjectives (up to 20) that you think your peers associate with femininity and masculinity.
    </p>

    <p>
    We will ask the same question 99 other NYU undergraduates and form an inventory of 20 most popular characteristics. You will be paid extra 20 cents for each item on your list that will be among the 20 most popular ones.
    </p>

    <p>
    Please note that we are asking you to report what you think others believe about femininity and masculinity, rather your personal definition. It is also in your best interest to match the responses of other participants.
